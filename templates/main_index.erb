          If you'd like a tilde.town account, just message me on
        <a href="https://twitter.com/nate_smith">twitter</a> with your <strong>desired
username</strong> and a link to a paste of your <strong>ssh pub key</strong>
(preferably in ssh-rsa format).  </p>

        <p>you can also mail me at <a href="mailto:nks@lambdaphil.es">nks@lambdaphil.es</a>. I tend to notice things on Twitter faster, though.</p>

        <h2>guidelines</h2>
        <p>this place is run exactly like tilde.club. You are free to refer to their FAQ/guidelines. We adhere to the same principles. In other words, no drama. No cruely. No trolls. I (~vilmibm) wield autocratric power and have no issues booting people who makes things unpleasant for others.</p>

        <h2>server</h2>
        <p>this runs on an ec2 micro using ubuntu 14.04. I am working on a <a href="https://github.com/nathanielksmith/puppet-tilde">puppet module</a> that allows anyone to easily provision a tilde-style server.</p>

 Have you guess 'd you yourself would not continue?
 The wanderer would not heed me
`` He told me at parting, that he should soon write
 Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition
 what is it to us what the rest do or think?
 I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill

 Come thou, arise from the ground unto the place yonder
 One was the son of Mars, and was killed before Troy
 He had done his duty and could return to his son.
 I never saw any thing so outree!
; woods, together with mountains, are on fire.
`` He told me at parting, that he should soon write

`` He told me at parting, that he should soon write
; and, abhorring the light, they fly { abroad} by night.
 Can not you guess what this parcel holds?''
 And these things I see suddenly, what mean they?
 And you, paid to defile the People
 Very strongly may be sincerely fainting.

 she cried with a most open eagerness
`` He told me at parting, that he should soon write
 Let me hear from you without delay
 By him she was put in mind of what she might do
; but Emma 's countenance was as steady as her words.
 Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.''

 It was certainly ‘barbara’ in the eyes of a Greek
 One can not creep upon a journey
 One was the son of Mars, and was killed before Troy
`` He told me at parting, that he should soon write
[ 77 and struck the guilty{ draught} from his mouth.
; The golden sun of June declines, It has not caught her eye.

 Clarke translates ‘miseri senis ore,
: naught there is Save body, having property of touch.
 Alas poor boy, he will never be better,
; but if he wished to do it, it might be done.
`` He told me at parting, that he should soon write
 One was the son of Mars, and was killed before Troy

 I knew who it came from. The virgin shrieks aloud
 To feel the presence of a brave commanding officer But she was always right.
 I 'd rather you would.'' This was a river of Troy
