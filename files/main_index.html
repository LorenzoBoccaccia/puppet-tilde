        <h1>tilde.town is a small unix server built for sharing</h1>
        <p>tilde.town is a clone of <a href="http://tilde.club">tilde.club</a>. It is still new and has plenty of space for new users. tilde.town is completely free to use.</p>

        <p>
          If you'd like a tilde.town account, just message me on
        <a href="https://twitter.com/nate_smith">twitter</a> with your <strong>desired
username</strong> and a link to a paste of your <strong>ssh pub key</strong>
(preferably in ssh-rsa format).  </p>

        <p>you can also mail me at <a href="mailto:nks@lambdaphil.es">nks@lambdaphil.es</a>. I tend to notice things on Twitter faster, though.</p>

        <h2>guidelines</h2>
        <p>this place is run exactly like tilde.club. You are free to refer to their FAQ/guidelines. We adhere to the same principles. In other words, no drama. No cruely. No trolls. I (~vilmibm) wield autocratric power and have no issues booting people who makes things unpleasant for others.</p>

        <h2>server</h2>
        <p>this runs on an ec2 micro using ubuntu 14.04. I am working on a <a href="https://github.com/nathanielksmith/puppet-tilde">puppet module</a> that allows anyone to easily provision a tilde-style server.</p>
